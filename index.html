Introduction</h3>

<p>
An ideal relaxation sensor reveals a quantity of interest, by changing the rate at which it thermally "relaxes" towards equilibrium. The out-of-equilibrium state of a relaxation sensor is optically distinguishable from the equilibrium state. To make a measurement, we drive the relaxation sensor away from equilibrium, and observe the rate at which the sensor returns to equilibrium, which depends on our quantity of interest. Figure 1 illustrates an example relaxation sensor, based on a photoswitchable fluorescent protein, which senses the concentration of a small molecule.

<p>
 In Figure 1's example, the relaxation sensor is a photoswitchable fluorescent protein that rapidly spontaneously equilibrates to the inactive state. The active state (top panel, top row) is fluorescent, and the inactive state (top panel, bottom row) is not. The sensor is engineered to transiently bind a molecule of interest; the bound form (top panel, left column) equilibrates to the inactive state more slowly than the unbound form (top panel, right column). We drive the sensor to the active state with cyan light (bottom panel, left cyan portion), and observe the rate at which fluorescence fades (bottom panel, right gray portion). By measuring this rate, we reveal the concentration of the target molecule.
</p>

<p>
How practical is this approach? All photoswitchable fluorescent proteins "relax", spontaneously equilibrating to some steady-state ratio of active and inactive states. Unfortunately, this process typically takes hours - much too slow for most sensing applications. Fortunately, we've spent several years engineering a photoswitchable fluorescent protein that rapidly spontaneously equilibrates to the inactive state, in seconds instead of hours. Starting from a <a href="https://www.fpbase.org/protein/dronpa/">Dronpa</a> derivative

Like Padron, Countdown photoswitches between a bright green fluorescent active state and a nonfluorescent inactive state. Cyan light activates and excites Countdown, violet light inactivates Countdown, and thermal equilibrium favors the inactive state.

As a proof-of-principle, we used Countdown to make a relaxation sensor for pH. We did three rounds of <a href="./appendix.html#countdown_mutagenesis">mutagenesis</a>, screening for strong pH-dependence in the first several seconds of the relaxation curve, to produce

<em><strong>Upper left panel</strong></em>: Timelapse <a href="./appendix.html#chicken_blaster">photography</a> of fluorescence (green) and reflected light (grayscale) during photoactivation and relaxation of pH-Countdown, in five capillary tubes, each buffered at a different pH.

<em><strong>Upper right panel</strong></em>: Like the upper left panel, except the capillary tubes are <u>underneath ~1 mm of chicken skin</u>.
 </figcaption>
</figure><p></p>

<p>
As we hoped, pH-Countdown's relaxation curves vary dramatically with pH, over a large pH range (bottom panel). After only a few seconds, the amount of relaxation for each pH is clearly distinguishable, allowing reasonably fast measurement (0.1-1 Hz). The short illumination duration during each image (500 &mu;s, 10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) <a href="./appendix.html#activation_due_to_measurement">does not cause measurable photoactivation</a>, and the low resolution yields a population-averaged measurement (like the bottom panel of Figure 1) rather than stochastic single-molecule kinetics (like the side panels of Figure 1).

Note that relaxation rates are several-fold faster at <a href="./appendix.html#temperature_dependence">37&deg;C than 25&deg;C</a>, and this sensor generally requires temperature calibration to yield quantitative pH measurements. 
</p>

<p>
The key point of Figure 2 is that burying our sample underneath a <em>millimeter</em> of partially opaque, highly autofluorescent chicken skin (upper right panel) does not affect the apparent pH reported by our relaxation sensor (bottom panel, open vs. filled circles). This is remarkable; no other fluorescent sensor has this property. What makes relaxation sensors so quantitatively robust despite opacity and background?

<p>
As shown in Figure 3, the signal from a single-color intensity sensor (top left panel, e.g. 

[<a class="citation" href="http://doi.org/10.1038/28190" title="Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins; Gero Miesenböck, Dino A. De Angelis &amp; James E. Rothman; Nature 394, 192–195 (1998)">Miesenböck 1998</a>])

is ambiguous. Brighter or dimmer signal might mean the amount of analyte changed, but could also mean the amount of sensor changed, or the amount of background, or the amount of illumination, or even the opacity of the sample. In some cases (e.g. calcium dynamics

[<a class="citation" href="http://doi.org/10.25378/janelia.13148243" title="jGCaMP8 Fast Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators; Y. Zhang, M. Rózsa, D. Bushey, J. Zheng, D. Reep, G. J. Broussard, A.

L Looger; (2020)">Zhang 2020</a>])

we can assume all confounding factors are constant over short timescales, and only analyte concentration varies. If so, we can infer analyte dynamics, but not analyte quantities.
</p>

<p>
Dual-color intensity measurements can help control for the amount of sensor. If both color channels are generated from a single fluorescent domain, their intensity ratio is self-normalizing,  and reveals absolute analyte quantities in highly transparent, background-free samples

Unfortunately, autofluorescence, scattering, or absorption from the sample distorts the ratio of the two channels. If the two channels come from two linked fluorescent proteins

(e.g. [<a class="citation" href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2011.08.012" title="Imaging Cytosolic NADH-NAD+ Redox State with a Genetically Encoded Fluorescent Biosensor; Yin Pun Hung, John G. Albeck, Mathew Tantama &amp; Gary Yellen; Cell Metabolism 14, 545–555 (2011)">Hung 2011</a>]),

the two proteins also won't mature, degrade, or photobleach at the same rate. These sources of sample-dependent systematic errors are quite common, and difficult to eliminate, predict, or calibrate.
</p>

<p>
The nanosecond-scale decay rate of a lifetime sensor (Figure 3, middle left panel) is self-normalizing and reveals absolute analyte quantity, in samples with no fluorescent background

(e.g. [<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.44522" title="Optical estimation of absolute membrane potential using fluorescence lifetime imaging; Julia R Lazzari-Dean, Anneliese MM Gest, Evan W Miller; eLife 8:e44522 (2019)">Lazzari-Dean 2019</a>,

Mahlandt, Janine J.G. Arts, Joep Beumer, Jens Puschhof, Saskia M.A. de Man, Anna O. Chertkova, Bas Ponsioen, Hans Clevers, Jaap D. van Buul, Marten Postma, Theodorus W.J. Gadella Jr. &amp; Joachim Goedhart; bioRxiv 2021.06.21.449214 (2021)">van der Linden 2021</a>]).

Lifetime measurement is expensive, slow, and rare compared to intensity measurement, but also valuable because nonfluorescent background, scattering, or absorption distorts intensities, but not decay rates. Unfortunately, <em>fluorescent</em> background distorts decay rates: the lifetime signal becomes the sum of at least two decaying exponentials, only some of which are due to the sensor (middle left panel of Figure 3 with <code>Animated quantity: Background</code> selected). The sum of two (or more) similar-rate exponentials is almost indistinguishable from a single-exponential with intermediate decay rate, and most (auto)fluorescence has similar fluorescent lifetime (1-5 ns). This causes sample-dependent systematic error which is quite common, and difficult to eliminate, predict, or calibrate. 
</p>

<p>
In contrast, the decay rate of a relaxation sensor (Figure 3, bottom left panel) is self-normalizing and reveals absolute analyte quantity. The single-spectral-channel timelapse measurement is compatible with other fluorophores, and simple hardware. The amount of sensor, amount of background, or emission attenuation due to scattering/absorption have <a href="./appendix.html#robust_against_perturbations">no systematic effect</a> on the normalized signal, yielding a robust sample-independent measurement (Figure 2, bottom panel).
</p>

<p>
Relaxation sensing shows incredible promise, but our current implementation leaves <a href="./index.html#discussion" target="_self">room for improvement</a>. pH-Countdown's apparent decay rate <a href="./appendix.html#activation_due_to_measurement">depends weakly on the amount of illumination</a> during measurement, because cyan light drives both activation and excitation (bottom left panel of Figure 3 with <code>Animated quantity: Illumination</code> selected). This can be calibrated by using the same illumination for calibration and measurement (Figures 4-7), or predicted since the activation rate reveals the amount of illumination, or eliminated by using low intensity illumination (Figure 2). A relaxation sensor engineered from a photoswitcher with decoupled activation/excitation would also eliminate this concern

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1952" title="A reversibly photoswitchable GFP-like protein with fluorescence excitation decoupled from switching; Brakemann T, Stiel Ac, Weber G, Andresen M, Testa I, Grotjohann T, Leutenegger M, Plessmann U, Urlaub H, Eggeling C, Wahl Mc, Hell Sw, Jakobs S; Nature Biotechnology, 29(10), 942-947 (2011)">Brakemann 2011</a>].

pH-Countdown's relaxation also takes at least a few seconds; signal interpretation is much simpler if the sample holds still during this time. Engineering faster relaxation sensors or developing more sophisticated analysis would allow faster-moving samples. We emphasize that the first implementation of relaxation sensing is hopefully also the worst.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental strength of relaxation sensing is that spontaneous decay signals do not resemble other signals that biological samples typically produce. In the unfortunate case where the sample photoswitches and spontaneously rapidly relaxes, we would have to use a relaxation sensor with a distinguishable (much faster or much slower) spontaneous rate. Fortunately, such samples are quite rare, in our experience.

We first drive pH-Countdown toward the inactive state with violet light (inset, vertical violet lines), and then acquire a series of images with cyan light (inset, vertical cyan lines) which <a href="./appendix.html#activation_due_to_measurement">drives pH-Countdown into the active state</a> (and out of thermal equilibrium).</p>

<p>
In some regions (solid green box), the signal is mostly due to the sensor, but many regions (dotted magenta box) have sensor-to-background ratios substantially below 1: most of the photoelectrons are from autofluorescent background. This situation is typical in <em>C. elegans</em>, and quite frustrating in our experience. No intensity- or lifetime-based sensor we've tried gives us any way to distinguish signal photoelectrons from background, so they all yield systematically distorted results in <em>C. elegans</em>

The key point of Figure 4 is that pH-Countdown's signal is distinguishable from autofluorescence, because pH-Countdown gets brighter with every image, and autofluorescence does not. As shown in Figure 5, relaxation sensing inherently rejects background, even in regions with terrible signal-to-background ratio.

<p>
The green "sensor" overlay in Figure 5 is simply the difference between the most-photoactivated and least-photoactivated frames from the timelapse in Figure 4. The paralyzed worm doesn't move during this ~3.5 s interval, and neither pH-Countdown nor autofluorescence <a href="./appendix.html#mitochondria_phcountdown_figure">bleach measurably</a> due to the 10 cyan exposures we use for a single photoactivation cycle. Therefore, the green "sensor" image is due only to photoactivation of pH-Countdown, and Poisson fluctuations from both the sensor and the background. Poisson fluctuations have zero mean, so background causes noise in the sensor signal, but no systematic distortion. Poisson fluctuations scale like the square root of the total counts, so even though the signal-to-background ratio is &lt;1 at many pixels, the signal-to-noise ratio is &gt;1 for most pixels with measurable sensor.
</p>

<p>
To estimate pH, we only need the green "sensor" channel. However, we can also estimate a "background" signal which is not due to pH-Countdown, shown as a magenta overlay in Figure 5. In this sample, the background channel clearly shows autofluorescent gut granules, familiar to any microscopist who has studied <em>C. elegans</em> with fluorescence. Since GFP-channel autofluorescence is quite similar to GFP fluorescence, this implies an exciting possibility: sensing with pH-Countdown uses the GFP spectral channel, but <em>does not interfere</em> with using GFP to tag another structure! Relaxation sensors like pH-Countdown are single-spectral-channel sensors, but from a multiplexing perspective, they consume <em>zero</em> spectral channels. We note that during mutagenesis to produce pH-Countdown, we produced <a href="./appendix.html#TODO">an entire mutational series</a> with intermediate photoswitching and spontaneous decay rates, and we speculate that these mutants could be the basis for highly-multiplexed fluorescent imaging in a single spectral channel.
</p>

<p>Figures 4 and 5 show that the <em>amount</em> of photoswitching lets us separate signal from background. Figure 6 shows how the <em>rate</em> of (photo)switching reveals our quantity of interest: pH.</p>

<p>The timelapse in Figure 6 shows the data from Figure 4, with background subtracted as in the green overlay of Figure 5. In addition to photoactivation, we also now show the relaxation interval, as illustrated in Figures 1, 2, and 3. Unlike Figure 2, we must leave the illumination off during relaxation to avoid <a href="./appendix.html#activation_due_to_measurement">perturbing the apparent relaxation rate</a>.
Distinct structures in this timelapse photoactivate and relax at clearly distinguishable rates (e.g. dotted blue box vs. solid yellow box).</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 2, the (photo)switching rates of pH-Countdown depend strongly on pH. We know pH-Countdown switching rates also depend (more weakly) <a href="./appendix.html#temperature_dependence">on temperature</a>, but as far as we know, there is no evidence for wild multi-&deg;C/&mu;m thermal gradients in live <em>C. elegans</em>. We are also unable to identify any other substantial <a href="./appendix.html#off_target_sensing">off-target sensing</a> for pH-Countdown, although we note that such testing is never exhaustive.
</p>

<p>Therefore, we choose to interpret the photoactivation and relaxation rates shown in Figure 6 as a map of pH vs. position, which we plot in false color in Figure 7.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure><p></p>

<p>We define the "relaxation ratio" as a pixelwise ratio of differences:
</p>
<div>
$$\begin{equation}
\frac{(\text{Image after activation}) - (\text{Image after relaxation})}{
(\text{Image after activation}) - (\text{Image after deactivation})}
\end{equation}$$
</div>
<p>Where '\(\text{Image after deactivation}\)', '\(\text{Image after activation}\)', and '\(\text{Image after relaxation}\)' correspond to frames 1, 10, and 11 of Figure 6, respectively. The relaxation ratio is a simple, robust estimator. As illustrated in Figure 3, it depends strongly on the rate of relaxation, but not on the quantity of sensor or quantity of background, and it depends only weakly on the amount of illumination. By comparing the observed relaxation ratio to a <a href="./appendix.html#elegans_imaging">calibration dataset</a>, we can account for the effects of illumination intensity, and convert our map of relaxation ratios to the map of pH vs. position shown in Figure 7.
</p>

<p>It's inherently futile to validate a sensor via an <em>in vivo</em> measurement, but the pH map in Figure 7 has several reassuring features. The inferred pH values are broadly consistent with the range we expect in living creatures. Continuous structures have smoothly-varying pH values, suggesting our measured values are not dominated by noise. Distinct structures have distinct pH values, suggesting our measured values are not independent of the sample. Some of the bright punctate structures have especially low pH, but some also have fairly high pH, suggesting our results are not simply an aggregation artifact. While these observations prove nothing, we find them highly encouraging, and consistent with all our experience using pH-Countdown.
</p>

<p>In our current impmlementation, there's a tradeoff between speed and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Figure 7 shows measured pH maps for three different values of <code>Relaxation Interval</code>, and the longest interval shows superior SNR compared to the shortest interval. In this case, waiting longer improves SNR, but this is only because our sample holds still.

Discussion</h3>
<h4>Will this work in mice?</h4>
<p>
One of our ambitions is to enable scientists and researchers to quickly, accurately measure the (sub)cutaneous concentration of a wide range of small molecules in freely-moving mice. We are optimistic, because a dead chicken is roughly optically equivalent to a live mouse. Of course, the chicken tends to hold still; to extend relaxation sensing to a wider range of creatures, we need strategies to deal with their motion.
</p>
<p>
The simple algorithms that produce Figures 5, 6, and 7 use pixelwise subtraction, which assumes the fluorophores at each pixel hold still during relaxation. More generally, we can compare any two regions across time if we're confident the two regions contain the same set of fluorophores. For example, <a href="./appendix.html#mitochondria_in_mammalian_cells">mitochondria move substantially during relaxation</a>, but we can still accurately calculate <a href="./appendix.html#mitochondria_phcountdown_figure">whole-cell relaxation ratios</a>. This approach trades spatial resolution for simplicity and accuracy, but this may be a useful trade in many contexts.
</p>

<p>
Another obvious strategy to enable relaxation sensing in rapidly moving samples is to make relaxation faster. A simple but impractical way to accelerate spontaneous relaxation is to raise the pH or the temperature. A more practical, but longer-term approach is to continue to mutate fluorophores like Countdown and pH-Countdown, while screening for rapid relaxation. We've been doing this successfully for years, and we plan to continue doing so. We expect slow but steady progress; nearly every round of mutagenesis we've done has yielded a slightly faster mutant.
</p>

<p>
Another strategy to deal with sample motion is to take our data more quickly. In this work, we intentionally used only simple <a href="./appendix.html#elegans_imaging">microscopy</a> and <a href="./appendix.html#chicken_blaster">photography</a> hardware, which we expect many other labs will also have access to. On such hardware, photoactivating pH-Countdown typically takes at least a few seconds, and relaxation several more. However, with brighter illumination on a faster microscope

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3244420" title="High NA single-objective light-sheet; Alfred Millett-Sikking, Kevin M. Dean, Reto Fiolka, Amir Fardad, Lachlan Whitehead, and Andrew G. York; doi:10.5281/zenodo.3244420 (2019)">Millett-Sikking 2019</a>],

we can take whole-cell 3D pH-Countdown photoactivation curves in 10-100 ms. As shown in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 6, the <em>activation</em> rate of a relaxation sensor also depends on our quantity of interest, and as shown in Figure 7 with <code>Measurement type: Sensor activation rate</code>, we can use this rate to infer pH. Activation rates also depend on illumination intensity, but this suggests an approach that uses photoactivation rates for high-speed measurement, calibrated by slow but accurate relaxation rate measurements.
</p>

<p>
We note two practical but important details that may ultimately limit the speed of relaxation sensing. While playing with a high-speed camera, we were quite surprised to notice that the autofluorescence of meat (e.g. chicken skin) shows slight photoswitching, with rapid spontaneous recovery on a ~50 ms timescale. This fast dynamic has no impact on our current (slow) approach, but if we succeed in engineering a 10-100x faster relaxation sensor, we'll have to account for this effect. In a similar spirit, we suspect that protonation equilibration times are effectively instantaneous compared to our current slow approach, but may become an important factor in the future.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we note that relaxation sensing naturally integrates over a finite time window. This is unsuitable for quick measurements in wiggly samples, but we could imagine contexts where measuring a time-averaged quantity is useful. As noted in our Results section, we have a series of mutants with spontaneous decay rates spanning the range from seconds to hours, which could be used to engineer time-integrating sensors.

Obviously, temperature, right?
External binding domain: Calcium sensing
Other reporter domains: NAD sensing
mention shy-RFP is already a relaxation sensor kinda. Red would be nice, too!
Mention Adam Cohen's work on things that are like relaxation sensors?

Multiplexing really belongs here.

Disruptive/nondisruptive measurement

<h4>Can we trust our measurement?</h4>
Oligomerization: the silent killer. Contrast ratio of padron depends tremendously on concentration.
Off-target sensing.
Somehow account for temperature?

<h4>Opportunities for inventors, innovators, and computational specialists.</h4>

For speed: tracking type approaches could allow us to tolerate sample motion

For sensing other things: can we tease apart the contributions from pH and Ca in the pH-Ca sensor we made? Can we tease apart the contributions from pH vs. temperature? How about intensity? Maybe multiplexing sensors is a good way to get at this!

For multiplexing: what's the right way to use our mutational series of photoswitching rates?
How can we infer each fluorophore population from a time series measurement?
The unmixing we do in Figure 5 is useful, but a little wrong. We use a single unmixing parameter, but a more sophisticated algorithm would account for the fact that the unmixing parameter is pH dependent. So we'd use rates to infer pH, pH to infer unmixing, etc. Full sensor-aware deconvolution would be even better!

For SNR: What's the right way to estimate a quantity-of-interest from our measurements? probably not relaxation ratio, or activation nonlinearity.
My gosh is sag-based rate estimation worse SNR than change-based rate estimation. This is obvious, from a certain perspective, but wasn't obvious to me a year ago.
